[introduction]
== Introduction

GenTaR is designed to coordinate the production of transgenic mice between high-throughput
mouse production facilities and consortia of clinicians and human geneticists while
minimizing the overlap and maximizing efficiencies. GenTaR captures the intention of a
consortium to produce mutant mice targeting a particular gene, and the progress of
mouse production. It records information about the mutation created, and tracks the
state of phenotyping performed on the mutant mouse line.

This is a secure resource that can house various types of mutations linked to genes,
and will provide different data access policies to users.

This guide is aimed at developers of such applications.

== Usage of HTTP Verbs

The following table describes how the GenTaR API interprets the HTTP verbs.

.HTTP Verbs
|===
|HTTP Verb | Usage

|GET
|GET is used to retrieve information without changing the state of the system.

|POST
|POST is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the system.

|PUT
|PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

|===

Other verbs, such as DELETE, are not supported by GenTaR at present.

== Pagination and Sorting
Most of the endpoints returning collections are paginated and can be sorted. If no parameters are
specified, then the default ones are applied.

=== Pagination
The parameters to specify the pagination are:
|===
|Parameter | Description
|page
|Number of the page to retrieve. It starts with 0 (which is the default value).
|size
|Number of elements to retrieve.

|===

=== Sorting
The parameters to specify the sorting are:
|===
|Parameter | Description
|sort
|Column and direction to sort, separated by comma. The directions are ASC or DESC.
Example: sort=tpn,ASC

|===

For example, to get the first 15 projects in the system, ordered by tpn, the call to the enpoint
would be:

 api/projects?page=0&size=15&sort=tpn,ASC

== Authentication
anchor:login[]

After a user is registered in the system (see: <<Create a user>>), they can start working with GenTaR.

The first step begins with logging into GenTaR using the /auth/signin endpoint.
The user issues a POST request to the endpoint and supplies the username and the password
credentials specified at registration as the JSON request payload (see the <<Login Data Structure>> example below).
A JSON Web Token (see https://jwt.io) is returned if the login is successful.

In all subsequent interactions with GenTaR the user provides the access token to authenticate each request to a protected route or resource.
The tokens are signed by the server so the server can validate the signature of the token to grant the access to resources.
The access token is a Base64 encoded String, that should be included as an Authorization HTTP header like this:

 Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJjb2RlcmFkYXIiLCJleHAiOjE0ODQ1MTUzOTUsInR5cGUiOiJSRUZSRVNIIiwiaWF0IjoxNDg0NTE1NDU1LCJ1c2VySWQiOiIxIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJyYWRhciJ9.zfkyc5jkPiAUEt7nU25SJxKprcPiXaiq0Q6bCJ_RrQo

The access token is short-lived and by default expires after 30 minutes.

A typical work flow follows this pattern:

. Client logs in with username and password to obtain a token
. Client interacts with resources in GenTaR by providing the access token in each request
. After 30 minutes client gets a 401-Response
. Clients logs in again and retrieves a new token to continue working with the system

[#_project_filters]
=== Filters
When you use request all projects, see the section <<Get all Projects>>, you can use filters on the result to select the information you require.

Filters are applied by appending the filter to the endpoint in the following fashion

 /api/projects?<filter name>=<value to use as the filter>

*Note:* the names of the filters are case sensitive.

Filter values can be supplied as a comma separated list

For example, you could use this request to obtain information about the projects
with the identifiers TPN:000000001 and TPN:000000004

 /api/projects?tpn=TPN:000000001,TPN:000000004

You can also combine filters in the following fashion

== State Machine interaction

=== Structure

Several entities in GenTaR rely on a state machine to control the logic to change from one status
to another. The state machines for these entities are described in the following document.

link:state_machine_transitions.pdf[state_machine_transitions.pdf]

When you make a GET request to one of those entities, as part of the response you will receive a *statusTransition*
section, which contains information about the current status and what actions can be executed in order
to change that status.

```json
"statusTransition" : {
    "currentStatus" : "Founder Obtained",
    "transitions" : [ {
    "action" : "abortWhenFounderObtained",
    "description" : "Abort the plan after a founder obtained",
    "triggeredByUser" : true,
    "available" : true,
    "note" : null,
    "nextStatus" : "AttemptAborted"
    } ],
    "actionToExecute" : null
```


|===
|Path|Type|Description

|`+statusTransition+`
|`+Object+`
|Information about the current state in the state machine for the plan.

|`+statusTransition.currentStatus+`
|`+String+`
|Current status in the plan

|`+statusTransition.transitions[]+`
|`+Array+`
|StatusTransitions in the state machine given the current state.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].action+`
|`+String+`
|Action or statusTransition's name.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].description+`
|`+String+`
|StatusTransition's description.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].triggeredByUser+`
|`+Boolean+`
|Indicates whether the statusTransition is executed by the user or by the system.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].available+`
|`+Boolean+`
|Indicates if the StatusTransition can be executed at the moment.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].note+`
|`+Null+`
|Additional explanation about the availability to execute the statusTransition.

|`+statusTransition.transitions[].nextStatus+`
|`+String+`
|Next status that the plan will have if the statusTransition is executed.

|`+statusTransition.actionToExecute+`
|`+Null+`
|Name of the statusTransition (action) to execute.


|===


=== Executing a change in the state machine
To execute a transition in the plan, you need to choose an action that is _triggeredByUser = true_
and _available = true_ and send a PUT request (as a normal plan update ) passing the name of the action
as the value _actionToExecute_ in the statusTransition section of the payload.


==== Example Request

Let's suppose you want to abort a crispr plan that has the status _Founder Obtained_. If we do a _GET_
to the plan we want to abort, you will see the _statusTransition_ section with a single available
state change executable by the user: *abortWhenFounderObtained*.

Use the name of the action (abortWhenFounderObtained) as the value in the field *actionToExecute*.

You can use the whole GET response as the payload for the new operation. You can also decide to send
only the _statusTransition_ information in the payload. The following is an example of a request
where you decide to leave out the attempt information:

Curl:
include::{snippets}/plans/putPlanStateMachine/http-request.adoc[]


==== Example Response

The response will indicate what has changed in the system, along with a link to the resource in
case you need to retrieve the new object.

== Lastest updates

* 2021-06-25: - Added the field esCellQcOnly to the Project entity to support projects that only relate to ES Cell QC.
              - Added documentation on the fields present in ES cell production plans.
              - Add documentation on the fields present in ES cell allele modification production plans.
              - Updated the state_machine_transitions document.
              - GET requests for ES cell and ES cell allele modification production plans are
                supported on the GenTaR Sandbox test database.
* 2021-02-24: Add two new filters to projects. One for production colony names and one for phenotyping external
              references.
* 2021-01-26: Phenotyping Stage state machine: The rollbackPhenotypingAllDataProcessed action used by the DCC
              now moves the PhenotypingAllDataProcessed state to PhenotypingAllDataSent rather than
              PhenotypingStarted.
* 2020-11-30: New filter 'doNotCountTowardsCompleteness' added for phenotyping plans.
* 2021-10-04: The 'species' field have been removed from project object.
* 2021-10-04: The 'funders' field in plans can be updated after plan created.
* 2021-10-04: The creAlleleModificationAttempt object have been *renamed* to eSCellAlleleModificationAttempt.
* 2021-10-04: Two *legacy* fields have been added to the esCellAlleleModificationAttempt object: 'imitsMouseAlleleModId' and
              'imitsTargRepAlleleId'. They will be read_only and only be there is the data was migrated from iMits.
* 2021-10-04: Three *legacy* fields have been added to the phenotypingAttemptResponse object: 'imitsPhenotypeAttemptId',
              'imitsPhenotypingProductionId' and 'imitsParentColonyId'. They will be read_only and only be there is the data was migrated from iMits.
* 2021-10-04: The *legacy* field 'imitsAllele' in mutation object has been renamed to 'imitsAlleleId' for consistency.
