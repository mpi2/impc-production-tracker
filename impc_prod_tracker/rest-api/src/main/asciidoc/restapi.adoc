[introduction]
== Introduction

GenTaR is designed to coordinate the production of transgenic mice between high-throughput
mouse production facilities and consortia of clinicians and human geneticists
while minimizing the overlap	and	maximizing	efficiencies. GenTaR captures the intention	of
a particular consortium	to produce mutant mice on a	particular	gene, the	progress	of
mouse	production	and	modified mutation creation on the	original mouse,	and	the	capture
of	phenotype	data	on	the	mouse.

This is a secure resource that can house various types of mutations linked to genes,
and will provide different data access policies to users.


This guide is aimed at developers of such applications.

== Usage of HTTP Verbs

The following table describes how the coderadar API interprets the HTTP verbs.

.HTTP Verbs
|===
|HTTP Verb | Usage

|GET
|GET is used to retrieve information without changing the state of the system.

|POST
|POST is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the system.

|PUT
|PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

== Authentication
anchor:login[]
A user has to log in to use other endpoints.
If the log in is successful, user obtains two JSON Web Tokens https://jwt.io

* an access token
* a refresh token.

How to use the tokens is described in <<authentication, Authentication>>

===== Login Data Structure
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/request-fields.adoc[]

===== Example Request
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/http-response.adoc[]
===== Response Structure
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/response-fields.adoc[]

==== Errors
===== Error when user/password is incorrect:
When trying to sign in with an incorrect user/password the system will inform about it returning
an error message.

.request
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/no-valid-user-password/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/no-valid-user-password/http-response.adoc[]

===== Error when there is not information in the system for the logged user:
If the user could be logged into the application but there is not further information related to
them (like the role or organisation information), a error is shown:

Request
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/no-info-for-user/http-request.adoc[]

Response
include::{snippets}/auth/signin/no-info-for-user/http-response.adoc[]

==== Authentication
After a user registered, he or she can start working with iMits2.
The first step is login. To log in in iMits2 use the <<login, Login>> endpoint. The user must use the username and the password
specified at registration. If the login was successful user gets a JSON Web Token (see https://jwt.io):

After that the user has to use the access token for authentication with each request to a protected route or resource.
The tokens are signed by the server so the server can validate the signature of the token to grant the access to resources.
The access token is a Base64 encoded String, that must be added to Authorization HTTP header like this:

 Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJjb2RlcmFkYXIiLCJleHAiOjE0ODQ1MTUzOTUsInR5cGUiOiJSRUZSRVNIIiwiaWF0IjoxNDg0NTE1NDU1LCJ1c2VySWQiOiIxIiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJyYWRhciJ9.zfkyc5jkPiAUEt7nU25SJxKprcPiXaiq0Q6bCJ_RrQo

The access token is short-lived and by default expires after 30 minutes.

A typical work flow looks like this:

. Client logs in with username and password and gets one token
. Client requires resources using the access token in each request
. After 30 minutes client gets a 401-Response
. Clients logs in again and gets a new token

== Projects Management
anchor:chapter-configure[]
This section describes the REST endpoints for projects in the system.

=== Project

A project defines some metadata about the project you want coderadar to analyze. With a project resource
and its sub-resources you provide coderadar with the information it needs to analyze the source code.


===== Example Request

include::{snippets}/projectSummaries/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example Response

include::{snippets}/projectSummaries/http-response.adoc[]
